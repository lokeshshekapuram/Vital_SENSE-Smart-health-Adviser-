### Vital Sense
The project "Vital Sense" introduces a comprehensive health diagnosis system that utilises Arduino technology to collect and display a range of vital health parameters. 
The system is designed to measure and analyse ECG, PPG, body temperature, heart rate, and stress levels in real-time.
The objective of this project is to design and implement an advanced E- Healthcare System that utilizes Arduino-based technology and multiple sensors.
Consisting ECG (Electrocardiogram), PPG (Photoplethysmogram), temperature, and stress level measurements for Personâ€™s Condition.
The system aims to monitor and analyze key health parameters in real- time, providing timely and accurate insights to users and healthcare professionals,facilitating early detection and prevention.
Here we've proposed a system in which the sensor detects the temperature, PPG, Heartbeat, and ECG of a person. 
It also displays the waveforms of these parameters. Additionally, we have added a feature in which the device displays specific values on certain gestures. improvise the text
